# CASA0015-Cart-Companion-APP


## Background
Shopping can be a time-consuming and exhausting task, especially when trying to manage multiple shopping lists, find discounts, and keep track of loyalty cards. Cart Companion is here to simplify the shopping experience, providing users with an all-in-one mobile application that streamlines and enhances their shopping trips.


### Storyboard

1.Shopping list management

Users can create, edit, and delete multiple shopping lists.
Each list displays the item name, quantity, and a checkbox to mark items as purchased.
Users can add items to the list by typing in the product name, brand, type, and quantity.

2.Barcode scanning and item details

Users can scan barcodes to quickly add items to their lists.
Scanning a barcode reveals detailed information about the product, including its brand, type, and pricing.

3.Loyalty card management

Users can store and manage their loyalty cards within the app.
Scanning a card's barcode adds it to the user's collection.
Users can access and present their loyalty cards at checkout directly from the app.

4.Social sharing

Users can share their shopping lists with friends and family through social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram.

5.Customizable app theme

Users can personalize the app's appearance by choosing from a selection of color schemes and themes.
